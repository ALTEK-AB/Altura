An app that allows you to view your ETH balance using 12 word recovery seed



### Ideas
1. Add a way to view your balance in other currencies
2. Refresh balance on home screen 
  - each time when visiting home screen
  - at regular interval (every 5 minutes) if the option is enabled
3. Implement Analytics so as to know which parts of the app are used the most
4. Implement CodePush to allow for faster production hotfixes
5. Implement Sentry for catching errors in Beta and Production environments
6. Store the database at a more secure custom location.  Over there, we can further encrypt its contents.
7. We can emulate multiple user accounts by having multiple user records with different PINs.  Then, we'll need to  
   track down the user record with the latest time stamp.
