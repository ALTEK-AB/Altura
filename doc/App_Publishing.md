# App/PlayStore Publishing Experiences

_Explain the process of publishing the app to the Play Store and Apple App Store, and
share any personal experience or anecdotal evidence you have._

I will share my experience in this field in list form and in two parts.  The first part will list the apps that I have in my previous employment and the second part will describe the process of publishing the app to the Play Store and Apple App Store.


### 1. Apps that have been published
VidaECafe - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vida-e-caff%C3%A8/id1453159485  
Krispy Kreme - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/krispy-kreme/id482752836  
M&B - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mugg-bean/id1250000041  
Bootlegger Coffee Company - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bootlegger-coffee-company/id1502686954  
Kauia - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kauai.juice  


### 2. Process of publishing
There are many actors involved in this process and I will be involving them as per their area of responsibility. Those actors include the company/client, the PM, developer(dev team + qa team),
UI team, Legal team, and the senior developer.

**- UI/UX Design**  
  The UI/UX team would prepare the assets to be used in this new publication or app release.  If the app has been  
  published before, the UI team would prepare the updated assets for the new release.  The assets include:

    - App icon and splash screen.
    - App screenshots.
**- Legal/PM Team + Dev Team**  
- Create app privacy policy.  
- Create app terms of service.  
- Create app end user license agreement.  
- Create app description.  

      Other than giving a meaningful description to the app's functionality, the description    
      should also include smart keywords that would help the app to be found and listed among the first on the app's stores.  
        - SEO practices should be applied to the app description.
        - Create app release notes.
        - Create app release version.  
        - The version number should follow the semantic versioning standard.  The version number should be  
        incremented based on the changes made to the app.  The version number should be incremented  
        based on the following rules:  
            - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
            - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and  
            - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.  

**- Action carried out by the senior developer**
  - Create developer account with Apple and Google stores on behalf of the company/client/PM/developer.
  - Create app on the developer account.
  - Testflight testing
    - Create app on Testflight.
    - Add testers to the app.
    - Send out email to testers to download the app.
    - Test the app in open and closed circles.
  - Release Information are either provided by the client/PM or the developer.
    - Create app release notes.
    - Create app release version.
  - Submit app for review.
    - App might get rejected if it fails the automatic store verification process.
    - If the app is rejected, the developer would need to fix the issues and resubmit the app for review.
    - As it happened before, there was a big opening day for a restaurant and the app was being blocked by the reviewer as  
      the updated policy was not being reflected on the client's website.  I liaised with the reviewer by phone, forwarded the  
      new policy to her, and then she approved the app while the website was being updated.  The app was reviewed in expedite.
- Publish app to the Play Store and Apple App Store.
- Hyper Care Monitoring
  - Monitor the app's performance and user feedback.
  - Monitor the app's reviews.
  - Handle any production bugs/crashes that might occur.
  - Push fixes either via CodePush( Over the Air Updated ) or plan for next patch/minor release
