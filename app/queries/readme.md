# Queries
Read operations are handled by the `Query` functions.  
It is a convention to name the query functions after the model they are querying.  

We may decide to query the database for a single record or a collection of records,  
return an observable record or an observable collection of records or a single value.  

Given the various options, we will house all the query functions under a single folder.
